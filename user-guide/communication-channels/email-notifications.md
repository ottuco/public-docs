# Email Notifications

Email is a widely used and reliable channel for sending payment-related notifications to customers. It provides an easy and secure way to communicate important payment details, such as payment confirmation, status updates, and any actions performed on the transaction (e.g., refunds, voids).&#x20;

## [**Prerequisites**](email-notifications.md#prerequisites)

To ensure Email notifications function smoothly, certain prerequisites must be met:

*   **Customer Email**: The customerâ€™s email field must be mandatory and provided during the creation of the payment transaction. To add the customer email and set it as a mandatory field, please contact [Ottu support team](mailto:support@ottu.com). \

*   **Enabling Email Templates:** Merchants can enable these templates by selecting the appropriate checkboxes during the payment transaction creation process, either before or after the payment, based on the specific requirement.\
