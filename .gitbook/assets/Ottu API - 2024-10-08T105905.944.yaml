    post:
      operationId: inquiry
      description: "The Check Status-Inquiry endpoint is part of our Payment Gateway\
        \ API. It's designed for checking the status of a specific payment transaction.\
        \ This endpoint is particularly useful when notifications about a transaction\
        \ status change haven't been received. It acts as a manual check for confirming\
        \ the payment status, mirroring the structure of a payment webhook notification.\
        \ \n\nThe Inquiry operation can only be triggered for payment transactions\
        \ in the `pending`, `attempted`, `failed`, or `expired` states. If the transaction\
        \ state is already `paid` or `authorized`, the response is returned immediately\
        \ without re-confirming it with third-party Payment Gateways (PGs). However,\
        \ if the system isn't up to date and the transaction state is still in one\
        \ of the mentioned states, Ottu will trigger an API call to the PG to update\
        \ the transaction state. If multiple payment options were attempted using\
        \ different PGs, all PGs supporting payment status checks will be called,\
        \ ensuring the merchant receives the most updated status of the payment. \n\
        \nThis endpoint uses a throttling mechanism to prevent potential system abuse.\
        \ Throttling rules are as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Grace Period (10 minutes):**\
        \ If the Inquiry endpoint is called within 10 minutes from when the payment\
        \ transaction is created, the request will be throttled.\n\n2. **First Request:**\
        \ Once the initial grace period has passed, the first request is allowed.\
        \ Subsequent requests for the same transaction within the next 30 minutes\
        \ will be throttled.\n\n3. **Second Request:** After the end of the first\
        \ throttle period, a second request is permitted. Further requests for the\
        \ same transaction within another 30 minutes from the second request are throttled.\n\
        \n4. **Subsequent Requests:** If the number of requests for the same transaction\
        \ exceeds three within the overall time frame, any further requests are denied.\n\
        \nNote: The above rules are applied per transaction. Additionally, the endpoint\
        \ allows a maximum of 30 requests per minute across all transactions.\n\n\
        It's mandatory to provide at least one of the identifiers (`session_id` or\
        \ `order_no`)."

        The Payment Operations API provides an interface to manage your payment transactions beyond their initial creation. It allows for several operations including `refund`, `capture`, `void`, and others, directly syncing with the Payment Gateway (PG) for certain actions to ensure consistency across systems.

        Two key identifiers, `order_no` and `session_id`, can be used interchangeably to specify the payment transaction that the operation should be applied to.

        For operations such as `refund` and `capture`, you can optionally define the `amount` to be actioned. If not provided, the API will attempt to perform the operation on the full amount, or the remaining amount if previous operations were conducted. However, note that for `void`, the operation always applies to the full amount, ignoring the `amount` value if provided.

        This API also allows you to perform certain operations solely at the Ottu system level, providing increased control over your payment transactions.

        For every operation, the API provides a clear response containing information about the executed operation, a user-friendly message (`detail`), and the operation's result (`success` indicates a successful operation).

          The Tracking-Key is a unique identifier provided by the merchant for each operation request.

          It is crucial for ensuring the distinctiveness of each operation.

          When initiating an operation, this key is stored alongside other transaction details in the database.

          It serves as a reference for future status queries.

            Specifies the minimum required validity period, in days, for a card to be eligible for payment. If set to 30 days, for example, cards set to expire within the next month would be declined. This ensures short-lived cards nearing their expiration date are filtered out, reducing chances of payment failures. When implementing, balance your operational needs with customer convenience. Setting it too stringent might increase payment declines, while a lenient approach could risk future payment failures.

            Additionally, it defaults to 30 days when the `payment_type` is `auto_debit`. If any other payment type is selected, no default value is set.

            This field allows you to define specific rules and conditions that a card must meet to be eligible for payment. These stipulations apply regardless of whether a customer chooses to pay using a saved card or opts to add a new card for the transaction. By leveraging the `card_acceptance_criteria`, you gain the power to fine-tune your payment processing strategy, tailoring acceptance rules to align with your business needs, security standards, and risk management policies.

            **Example**: If you run an exclusive service that caters predominantly to premium customers, you might set criteria that only allow transactions from high-tier credit cards like VISA Platinum. This ensures that payments align with the exclusivity and branding of your services. Remember to configure these criteria thoughtfully. Striking the right balance between security, risk mitigation, and user experience is paramount.

            **Note**: The `card_acceptance_criteria` field is applicable only for direct payments and not for hosted session payments.

            This field allows you to define specific rules and conditions that a card must meet to be eligible for payment. These stipulations apply regardless of whether a customer chooses to pay using a saved card or opts to add a new card for the transaction. By leveraging the `card_acceptance_criteria`, you gain the power to fine-tune your payment processing strategy, tailoring acceptance rules to align with your business needs, security standards, and risk management policies.

            **Example**: If you run an exclusive service that caters predominantly to premium customers, you might set criteria that only allow transactions from high-tier credit cards like VISA Platinum. This ensures that payments align with the exclusivity and branding of your services. Remember to configure these criteria thoughtfully. Striking the right balance between security, risk mitigation, and user experience is paramount.

            **Note**: The `card_acceptance_criteria` field is applicable only for direct payments and not for hosted session payments.

            IMPORTANT: This field determines the channel through which the payment is being made and has a direct impact on the redirection behavior post-payment.

            For Web (`web_sdk`):
            - The payer will be redirected to the payment details page where they can complete the payment process. Use the code: `window.location.href = redirect_url` and the browser will handle any further redirects.

            For Mobile SDK (`mobile_sdk`):
            - The `redirect_url` should be opened in a webview. This is the page where the payer will enter their card details.
            - After entering the card details, the payer will be redirected to the final payment details page within the webview.
            - Detect the URL redirection by listening to redirects within the webview. When a redirect occurs to the URL `{merchant_id}/b/gw/mobile-sdk-redirect`, close the webview. This indicates that the payment process has completed.
            - After closing the webview, reload the SDK and call the `Retrieve init data API` to display the payment from `response object` to the payer.

            Note:  `merchant_id` is the same ID used to build the `Fetch retrieve data API` and is the parameter added in the CheckoutSDK.init method.

            **Example**: If you run an exclusive service that caters predominantly to premium customers, you might set criteria that only allow transactions from high-tier credit cards like VISA Platinum. This ensures that payments align with the exclusivity and branding of your services. Remember to configure these criteria thoughtfully. Striking the right balance between security, risk mitigation, and user experience is paramount.

            \nThis capability ensures precise control over the refund amounts for\

            \ It is imperative to include the document number for each ticket involved\
            \ in the refund operation. This ensures that the refund is accurately\
            \ applied to the correct tickets within an order.\n\n`amount`: Alongside\
            \ each ticket document number, specify the desired refund amount for that\

            \  If certain tickets within an order should not be refunded, you can\
            \ specify a refund amount of zero for those tickets. This approach allows\
            \ for selective refunding within a single order.\n\n`Important Note`\n\
            \nAll tickets intended for refund must be explicitly listed in the refund\
            \ order details, with their respective refund amounts clearly defined.\
            \ This requirement ensures comprehensive and error-free processing of\
            \ partial refunds.\n\n<b>Example</b>\n\ncheck in Request samples there\

            `ottu_pg`:
            - **Web SDK**: Directly redirect the payer to the provided `redirect_url` using: `window.location.href = redirect_url`.
            - **Mobile SDK**: Open the `redirect_url` directly in a webview. Ensure you append the query string `channel=mobile_sdk` to the end of the URL, taking care with the concatenation if the `redirect_url` already contains other query parameters.

            Common Webview Closing Method (for both `redirect` and `ottu_pg` in Mobile SDK):
            Detect the URL redirection by listening to redirects within the webview. When a redirect occurs to the URL `{merchant_id}/b/gw/mobile-sdk-redirect`, close the webview. This indicates that the payment process has completed. After closing the webview, reload the SDK and call the `Retrieve init data API` to display the payment result to the payer. Note: `merchant_id` is the same ID used to build the `Fetch retrieve data API` and is the parameter added in the CheckoutSDK.init method.

These stipulations apply regardless of whether a customer chooses to pay using a saved card or opts to add a new card for the transaction. By leveraging the `card_acceptance_criteria`, you gain the power to fine-tune your payment processing strategy, tailoring acceptance rules to align with your business needs, security standards, and risk management policies.

            **Example**: If you run an exclusive service that caters predominantly to premium customers, you might set criteria that only allow transactions from high-tier credit cards like VISA Platinum. This ensures that payments align with the exclusivity and branding of your services. Remember to configure these criteria thoughtfully. Striking the right balance between security, risk mitigation, and user experience is paramount.

            **Note**: The `card_acceptance_criteria` field is applicable only for direct payments and not for hosted session payments.

            1. `redirect`:
            - **Web SDK**: After submitting the payload as per `Submit redirect payment method API`, you will receive a `redirect_url`. Redirect the payer to this URL using: `window.location.href = redirect_url`.
            - **Mobile SDK**: After submitting the payload, open the received `redirect_url` in a webview.

            = redirect_url`.
            - **Mobile SDK**: Open the `redirect_url` directly in a webview. Ensure you append the query string `channel=mobile_sdk` to the end of the URL, taking care with the concatenation if the `redirect_url` already contains other query parameters.

            Common Webview Closing Method (for both `redirect` and `ottu_pg` in Mobile SDK):
            Detect the URL redirection by listening to redirects within the webview. When a redirect occurs to the URL `{merchant_id}/b/gw/mobile-sdk-redirect`, close the webview. This indicates that the payment process has completed. After closing the webview, reload the SDK and call the `Retrieve init data API` to display the payment result from `response object` to the payer. Note: `merchant_id` is the same ID used to build the `Fetch retrieve data API` and is the parameter added in the CheckoutSDK.init method.

            Use `window.location.href = redirect_url` to redirect the payer to the
            specified URL. For mobile SDK integrations: Open the `redirect_url` in
            the webview. Upon redirecting to the provided URL, the webview should
            be closed and the transaction refreshed using the `Checkout SDK / Retrieve
            init data API`. Detect the URL redirection by listening to redirects in
            the webview. When a redirect occurs to a URL containing the `merchant_id`

            Indicates the form of payment used to process the transaction. This can be one of several options, including `apple_pay`, `google_pay`, `token_pay`, `stc_pay`, `urpay`, or `redirect`.It's important to note that the `redirect` option is only present in the `errorCallback`. In other scenarios, especially with `cancelCallback` and `successCallback`, it's absent. This is because, in the redirect flow, the customer is redirected to a different page where actions like payment cancellation or confirmation occur, not on the page where the SDK is displayed.

            error messages, especially for on-site payments undergoing a challenge
            flow. For example, after a failed 3DS verification, it's useful to show
            a custom popup informing the user of the payment failure. However, it's
            crucial to note that not all on-site failed payments need custom error
            messaging. In cases like GooglePay or ApplePay, error messages are inherently
            handled by the Payment Sheet, which remains open for the user to retry,

            Indicates the form of payment used to process the transaction. This can be one of several options, including `apple_pay`, `google_pay`, `token_pay`, `stc_pay`, `urpay`, or `redirect`.It's important to note that the `redirect` option is only present in the `errorCallback`. In other scenarios, especially with `cancelCallback` and `successCallback`, it's absent. This is because, in the redirect flow, the customer is redirected to a different page where actions like payment cancellation or confirmation occur, not on the page where the SDK is displayed.

By leveraging the `card_acceptance_criteria`, you gain the power to fine-tune your payment processing strategy, tailoring acceptance rules to align with your business needs, security standards, and risk management policies.

This ensures that payments align with the exclusivity and branding of your services. Remember to configure these criteria thoughtfully. Striking the right balance between security, risk mitigation, and user experience is paramount.
