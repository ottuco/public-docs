# Renew Contract

Ottu empowers merchants to seamlessly renew existing contracts. Detailed explanations on how to initiate Contract Actions are accessible [here](./#to-trigger-contract-actions).&#x20;

When merchants select **Renew Contract**, the system will redirect them to the [Renewal Contract Form ](renew-contract.md#renew-contract-form)for further processing.
