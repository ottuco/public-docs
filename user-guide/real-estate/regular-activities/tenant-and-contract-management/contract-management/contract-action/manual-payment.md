# Manual Payment

Ottu enables merchants to perform manual payments easily through a streamlined process.  Explanations on how to trigger Manual payment is available in the [Contract Actions](./#to-trigger-contract-actions) section. Upon triggering the manual payment action, a [Manual Payment Form](manual-payment.md#manual-payment-forms) is presented.

{% hint style="info" %}
To initiate a manual payment, invoices must be generated through the [Generate Invoices](../../../generate-invoice.md) section beforehand.
