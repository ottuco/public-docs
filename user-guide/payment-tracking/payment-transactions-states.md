### [**Child Payment States**](payment-transactions-states.md#child-payment-states)

Within the dynamic landscape of online payment transactions, The below table provides a comprehensive breakdown of [child states](payment-transactions-states.md#child-payment-transaction), their corresponding [parent states](payment-transactions-states.md#parent-payment-transaction), and succinct descriptions. Here, The parent state represents the initial status of a payment transaction before it progresses to any of its child states.

### [**Attempt States**](payment-transactions-states.md#attempt-states)

Payment attempt states represent the payment state at the customer end.

| Payment-Attempt State |             Description                                                                                                                |                    Note                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pending**           | The customer has viewed the transaction details.                                                                                       | <p><br></p>                                                        |
| **Failed**            | Payment failed due to various reasons, such as insufficient funds and other related issues.                                            | The number of attempts is determined by the payment configuration. |
| **Canceled**          | The customer has chosen to click the cancel button.                                                                                    | <p><br></p>                                                        |
| **Success**           | The payment attempt was successful (i.e., successful pay).                                                                             | <p><br></p>                                                        |
| **Error**             | When a payment error has been encountered from PG side, such as the PG Service being unavailable, experiencing a network issue, … etc. | <p><br></p>                                                        |

{% hint style="info" %}
When **COD** (Cash on Delivery) is used for cash payments, a payment attempt is created. This is because every change in the final state of the payment transaction must be associated with a payment attempt.

## [State Combinations](payment-transactions-states.md#state-combinations)

Understanding the various possible combination of Payment Transactions that are in the <mark style="color:orange;">`attempted`</mark> state with the Payment-Attempts states is crucial. Let's simplify them:

**For the payment transactions that allow multiple attempts, we encounter two combinations:**

* When a Payment Transaction is in the <mark style="color:orange;">`attempted`</mark> state, and the Payment-Attempt state is <mark style="color:red;">`canceled`</mark> or <mark style="color:red;">`failed`</mark>, the payment transaction state remains <mark style="color:orange;">`attempted`</mark>. That means that the transaction is open for another attempt until it either expires (i.e., <mark style="color:red;">`expired`</mark> state) or successfully reaches the <mark style="color:green;">`paid`</mark> state.\
  **In simple terms:**\
  <mark style="color:orange;">`attempted`</mark> state for payment transaction ➕ <mark style="color:red;">`canceled`</mark> or <mark style="color:red;">`failed`</mark> state for payment attempt ➡ <mark style="color:orange;">`attempted`</mark> state for payment transaction, until it changed to <mark style="color:red;">`expired`</mark> or <mark style="color:green;">`paid`</mark>, and the payment transaction can be attempted again
* Alternatively, when a Payment Transaction is in the <mark style="color:orange;">`attempted`</mark> state and the Payment-Attempt succeeds (i.e., <mark style="color:blue;">`success`</mark> state), the payment transaction progresses into the <mark style="color:green;">`paid`</mark> or <mark style="color:green;">`authorized`</mark> state.\
  **In simple terms:**\
  <mark style="color:orange;">`attempted`</mark> state for payment transaction ➕ <mark style="color:blue;">`success`</mark> state for payment attempt ➡ <mark style="color:green;">`paid`</mark> or <mark style="color:green;">`authorized`</mark> state for payment transaction.

**For the payment transactions that do not allow multiple attempts:**

* Such transactions do not have an <mark style="color:orange;">`attempted`</mark> state. Instead, they can either be in a <mark style="color:red;">`failed`</mark> or <mark style="color:green;">`authorized`</mark> state.

The following image sums it all up clearly:
