# Notification Process: Automatic and Manual

In this section, we will explore when notifications are sent to customers and how merchants can manually trigger them.

## [Email, SMS, and Integrated WhatsApp Channels](notification-process-automatic-and-manual.md#email-sms-and-integrated-whatsapp-channels)

These channels send notifications to customers in two ways:

1. **Automatic Notification**: A notification is automatically sent to the customer once a specific trigger state occurs.
2. **Manual Notification**: Merchants can manually trigger notifications by clicking on the three dots under the **Action** header within the Transaction Table. Then, select the icon of the desired notification channel (Email, SMS, or WhatsApp). Typically, the **Action** header is located at the end of each transaction row in the Transaction Table. For more details, refer to the [Transaction Table](../payment-tracking/payment-transactions-insights.md#transaction-table) section.

## [Manual WhatsApp Channel](notification-process-automatic-and-manual.md#manual-whatsapp-channel)

This channel does not send notifications automatically. Merchants must manually trigger WhatsApp notifications through [Transaction Table](../payment-tracking/payment-transactions-insights.md#transaction-table) as mentioned in the above section.<br>
