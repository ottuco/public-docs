# Suspend Contract

Once a contract is suspended, all transactions related to the invoices associated with this contract cannot be paid anymore. This means that tenants are unable to make any payments against these invoices until the contract is resumed.

Merchants can easily suspend a contract from Contract Action list. For further information on how to trigger contract suspension actions, please refer to the [Contract Actions](broken-reference) section.
