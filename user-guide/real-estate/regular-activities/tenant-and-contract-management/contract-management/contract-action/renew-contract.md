# Renew Contract

Ottu empowers merchants to seamlessly renew existing contracts. Detailed explanations on how to initiate Contract Actions are accessible [here](broken-reference).&#x20;

When merchants select **Renew Contract**, the system will redirect them to the [Renewal Contract Form ](renew-contract.md#renew-contract-form)for further processing.

#### Renew Contract Form

Most of the information will be filled automatically after selecting the [parent contract](renew-contract.md#parent-contract) and cannot be modified.

Merchant should fill:

*   #### New Contract End Date:&#x20;

    The proposed end date for the renewed contract.

Below will be automatically populated based on the chosen [parent contract](renew-contract.md#parent-contract) but can be modified.

*   #### New Contract Amount:&#x20;

    Rent amount for the [unit](broken-reference).
*   #### New Original Contract Amount:&#x20;

    The maximum amount that the merchant can demand the customer to pay within each [phase](renew-contract.md#payment-period) of payment.
*   #### Contract Reference: &#x20;

    A unique identifier or code assigned to the contract for tracking and reference purposes.
*   #### Upload Attachment:&#x20;

    Any relevant documents or attachments related to the contract renewal.
