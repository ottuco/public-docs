# Resume Contract

When a [suspended contract](suspend-contract.md) is resumed, all transactions related to the invoices associated with this contract become payable again. This means that tenants can once again make payments against these invoices, and the contract returns to its active status.

How to trigger Resume Contract is explained [here](./#to-trigger-contract-actions).&#x20;
