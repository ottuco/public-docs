# WhatsApp Notifications

WhatsApp provides a more conversational way to communicate payment information. With its widespread use, WhatsApp notifications offer customers a user-friendly and familiar platform for receiving updates, especially in regions where the app is frequently used for business communications.&#x20;

Ottu empowers merchants to notify the customer via WhatsApp communication channels via two different ways:

* **Integrated WhatsApp Channel:** The WhatsApp communication channel automatically sends payment-related notifications to customers using their phone numbers. Integrated with Ottuâ€™s [Payment Requests](../../plugins/payment-request.md) and [E-Commerce](../../plugins/e-commerce.md) plugins, it offers businesses a quick and flexible way to communicate, enhancing customer engagement through a popular platform. For more information, please check [Integrated WhatsApp Channel](integrated-whatsapp-channel.md) section.
* **Manual WhatsApp Channel:** The merchant manually notifies the customer via WhatsApp. Once the merchant initiates the WhatsApp notification process, they are redirected to the WhatsApp server where the pre-payment template is displayed, allowing the merchant to proceed with sending the notification. For further details, please refer to [Manual WhatsApp Channel](manual-whatsapp-channel.md) section.

WhatsApp notifications are currently implemented only for [Payment Request](../../plugins/payment-request.md) and [E-Commerce](../../plugins/e-commerce.md) plugins, and are limited to pre- and post-payment states.
