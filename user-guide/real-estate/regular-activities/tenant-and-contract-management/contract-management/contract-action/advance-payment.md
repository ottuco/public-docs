# Advance Payment

Ottu provides a seamless workflow for merchants to process advance payments efficiently. Detailed instructions for initiating advance payments are available in the [Contract Actions](./#to-trigger-contract-actions) section.

*   To generate the advance payment request, merchants should select the necessary invoices. \

#### How to send Advance Payment Request?

* After selecting the required advance payment, if the merchant proceeds with saving without checking the Manual Payment option, an email will be sent to the tenant requesting them to pay for the advance payment.
*   If the merchant checks the Manual Payment box, they will proceed with the selected advance payment using the same process as manual payment. For more information, please refer to the [Manual Payment](manual-payment.md) section.\
