There are three types of currency configuration:

* [Currencies](currencies.md#currencies) (adding and managing different currencies)
* [Currency exchanges](currencies.md#currency-exchanges) (setting up currency exchange)
* [Exchanges config](currencies.md#exchange-configuration) (defining currency rules for the [payment gateway](payment-gateway.md))

Each type serves a distinct purpose and aspect in enabling smooth and efficient transactions. These configurations empower merchants to navigate the complexities of multiple currencies, facilitate currency exchanges, and define specific currency rules for payment gateways.

### [Currency Exchanges](currencies.md#currency-exchanges)

Sometimes, merchants may prefer receiving payments in their local currency, even when the customer resides in a different country. To facilitate this payment process, Ottu offers a convenient currency exchange service that benefits merchants and customers, enhancing seamless payment processes. Occasionally, when the bank acts as an intermediary between the merchant and the customer, they may impose a markup fee to cover the currency exchange fees.\
