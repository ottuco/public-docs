# SMS Notifications

SMS is a fast and convenient channel for sending payment-related notifications to customers. With high open rates and immediate delivery, SMS is ideal for sending concise, time-sensitive payment details such as payment confirmations, status updates, or critical actions performed on a transaction (e.g., refunds, voids).&#x20;
