# Transactions

## [**Transaction Dashboard**](transactions.md#transaction-dashboard)

The **Transaction Dashboard** can be accessed through the **Ottu Real Estate Dashboard** located in the **Main Listing Section**. It provides a clear overview of all initiated transactions, offering valuable insights such as:

* **Total Generated Amount:** The cumulative value of all transactions.
* **Total Received Amount:** The amount successfully collected from transactions.
* **Net Balance:** The difference between the generated and received amounts.

Additionally, a **detailed transaction table** displays a comprehensive history of each transaction, including key details like:

* **Transaction State**
* **Amount**
* **Order Number**
* And more...

These details allow merchants to monitor and track transaction performance effectively.

## [**Disclose to Merchant**](transactions.md#disclose-to-merchant)

At the end of each transaction row in the **Transaction Table**, there is an **Action Column**. From there, merchants can trigger a **Disclose to Merchant**, which retrieves and discloses detailed transaction data directly to the real estate service.

This feature ensures transparency and provides real-time updates on transaction statuses.
