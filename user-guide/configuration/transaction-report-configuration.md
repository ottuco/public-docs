## [Report Fields](transaction-report-configuration.md#report-fields)

In this section, we will guide you through the process of incorporating extra fields into both [periodic](transaction-report-configuration.md#periodic-transaction-report-configuration) and [flexible](transaction-report-configuration.md#flexible-interval-transaction-reports) transaction reports. These fields will share the same categorization and description across both report types. The required fields are categorized based on the source type from which the data is extracted. The categories are as follows: [Config](transaction-report-configuration.md#config), [Static](transaction-report-configuration.md#static), [Gateway Response](transaction-report-configuration.md#gateway-response), and [Common](transaction-report-configuration.md#common), and each type requires different information.

To add new fields, follow these straightforward instructions:

1. Access the **Transaction Report Field** tab or **Periodic Transaction Report Field** tab.
2. Click on  `Add another transaction report fields`.
3. You will receive a dropdown list containing all the available field type.&#x20;

**Descriptive details for each field type, as well as the required information, are detailed below.**

***

#### [Config](transaction-report-configuration.md#config)

**Config fields:** Represent the values derived from configured items within a flexible, customizable dropdown list.

**Required Information:**

* **Field:** it is user-friendly, dropdown list allows for choosing the required Config fields to be displayed in the report. It offers the flexibility to add or remove built-in or custom fields, tailoring it to your specific needs.

***

#### [**Static**](transaction-report-configuration.md#static)

**Static fields:** Contain unchanging or predefined data elements that are included in the report. These fields do not vary with each transaction and often serve as constants or reference data. Static fields are essential for establishing a baseline or providing consistent information.

**Required Information:**

* **Static value:** Assign a value to the constant field. It will be the same for all generated reports.

***

#### [**Gateway response**](transaction-report-configuration.md#gateway-response)

**Gateway Response** **fields:** Include data obtained from interactions with [payment gateways](../payment-gateway.md). These fields contain information related to the response received from the payment gateway after processing a transaction. They can include details about the transaction's success, authorization, and other gateway-specific information.

**Required Information:**

* **Gateway response keys:** Since the PG (Payment Gateway) response is sent in a dictionary format, i.e., a set of key-value pairs {Key:Value}, so here you specify the keys of the values you need.

***

#### [**Common**](transaction-report-configuration.md#common)

**Common fields:** These are data elements that differentiate themselves from fields that originate from payment gateways (PG), static data, and plugin configurations. These fields serve as foundational components in transaction reports, offering essential information that remains consistent across all report types. Example of such element include “payment\_date.”

***

**Shared Required Information**

Besides the previously mentioned Required Information for each type, all types also require the completion of the following fields.

* **Is active:** If checked, the field will be used and displayed.
