# SDK Configuration

## [Language](sdk-configuration.md#language) <a href="#language" id="language"></a>

The SDK supports two languages, English and Arabic, with English set as the default.

It automatically adopts the language configured in the device settings, requiring no in-app adjustments. However, if a transaction is initiated in a different language and setup preload is utilized, the backend-generated text (such as fee descriptions) will appear in the language of the transaction. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the language code passed to the [Checkout API](../../checkout-api.md)'s transaction creation request matches the currently selected language on the device or current selected app language.

## [Light and dark theme](sdk-configuration.md#light-and-dark-theme) <a href="#light-and-dark-theme" id="light-and-dark-theme"></a>

The SDK supports UI customization to match the device themeâ€”light or dark. This adjustment is applied during the SDK initialization, based on the device's settings. Similarly, for language, no adjustments are made within the app.
